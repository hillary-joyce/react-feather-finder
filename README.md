# React Feather Finder
Feather Finder is a memory game built using react js. 
Click on the feathers to earn points, but don't click on a feather more than once!

## Getting Started

head over to the [Heroku Page](https://enigmatic-retreat-98619.herokuapp.com/)to get started.

The page consists of 12 feathers, all slightly different.

The goal is to click on each of the feathers just once to earn a high score.

Click on a feather more than once, and the game starts over.

Be careful! The feathers shuffle each time you click one.
